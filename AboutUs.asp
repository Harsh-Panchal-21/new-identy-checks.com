<h2><strong>About Us</strong></h2>
<h4><strong>Identi-Check was established in 1998 and is headquartered in Springfield Illinois.</strong></h4>
<p>Business owners can't afford to overlook the risk of exposure to a problematic and  dishonest employee. The most cost effective way to mitigate risks is from the  start, 
when the individual is only a potential candidate. Employers have the  advantage by prescreening to their hiring process. If an organization cannot  demonstrate it has 
adequately prepared for, and is procedurally consistent in  its efforts to provide a secure work place, it leaves itself vulnerable to  adverse actions and potential 
lawsuits from violated employees or customers.

Identi-Check, Inc. specializes in background and drug screening and it is our mission to help businesses with their hiring needs by providing them with valuable information on their potential employees. Identi-Check, Inc. wants to improve businesses’ good hiring practices by helping them find the best qualified people for the positions being filled and in return decrease employee turnover. In today’s business environment, there is an abundance of well qualified people on a quest for work. There is no reason for businesses to pay the price from hiring substandard employees, who could potentially harm the business’s well earned reputation, deplete cherished assets or even harm employees and customers.
Employees can make the difference in a business's rate of success and they are the greatest asset of every business. Hiring managers at major companies point out that the threat of lawsuits alleging discriminatory hiring practices causes them to carefully investigate job candidates' background history and whether thorough background checks and/or drug testing have been done.

We would be honored if you gave us the opportunity to serve you in the future.
