<strong>Employment Credit Report</strong> -  Credit reports can be a valuable tool for evaluating applicants who’s position may involve financial responsibility. The report includes the applicant's credit history, providing an objective overview of how financial obligations are handled over a period of time. An Employment Credit Report differs from a traditional credit report, in that it is tailored for use in an employment situation. Therefore, it does not include account numbers, nor does it provide credit score or have any type of effect of the persons credit, and otherwise known as a “soft credit hit”.  The Employment Insight Report from Experian enhances traditional employment decision making tools by providing credit information which would not normally appear on an application, but may have an impact on job performance. Credit information provides insight into an applicant’s responsibility toward his/her personal obligations, and integrity and ability to fulfill financial obligations for a potential employer.
