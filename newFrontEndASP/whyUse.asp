<h2>State and Federal Compliance </h2>
<p>
The Fair Credit Reporting Act sets the standard for how an employer collects and uses background information in determining whether or not an applicant is qualified for a position. 
The FCRA regulates Consumer Reporting Agencies (CRA’s) are entities that collect and disseminate information about consumers to be used for credit evaluation and certain other purposes, including employment. Credit bureaus, a type of consumer reporting agency, hold a consumer's credit report in their databases. CRAs have a number of responsibilities under FCRA. Employers who conduct their own background checks do not need to follow the FCRA, but put themselves at greater liability. 
Under the FCRA, the employer must obtain, in writing, Authorization for release of information to complete the background check. Additionally if the employer decides to not hire an applicant based on the results of the background check, a pre-adverse action letter must be provided to the applicant. The letter should state a reasonable time to dispute the report. Once the dispute is completed and a contention is not made or the employer still decides to not employee the applicant; under the FCRA, the employer must send the applicant the adverse action letter. 
By utilizing a CRA to conduct pre-employment screening and following the FCRA, employers help protect themselves from liability. If an employer NOT following the guidelines of the FCRA and incorrectly denies a person employment can expose the employer to potential lawsuits.
Employee evaluations with background checks are common business practice for many companies and requires the consent of your employees under the FCRA.
<br /><br />
An employer may decide that frequent background checks are required for employees depending on the positions they hold. Under the circumstances, background checks on an annual or when an employee is up for a promotion, are perfectly acceptable as long as the employee has given permission ahead of time, which can be done one of two ways. 
Two ways to conduct frequent evolutions that consist of a background check are acceptable. The most important part is the employee has given permission as directed under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). An employer may state in the original authorization for release of information how often background checks will conducted in order to maintain employment, the applicant must approve. Option two would be to have the employees sign the authorization for release of information each time they perform a background check.
Employees’ rights, knowing them can help an employer avoid situations that could possibly turn into legal damages. 
The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) protects applicants rights when conducting background checks. Furthermore, some states even offer additional rights to the applicants. First of all,  applicant must be formally told if information is used against them based on the background check conducted by the employer using a background check company. This is conducted using a pre-adverse action letter and/or then the adverse action letter, giving enough time to dispute the report.
In the pre-adverse action letter the employees’ rights allow them the ability to dispute what was reported on their background check. The background check company is then obligated to investigate the dispute. Normally, at this point, the search in question is re-run and if any error was made by the source from where the information was pulled, the correction is made and both the employer and employee are notified. According to the employees’ rights under the FCRA, the background check company must make the corrections or deletions within 30 days of the dispute. 
The background check company who completed the report can only share information with the potential employer and the job applicant. It cannot be resold or shown to any other entity. Finally, a report cannot be completed on an employee without their written consent.
