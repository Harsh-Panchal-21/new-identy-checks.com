<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p>
<strong>Why should I do background screenings?</strong><br />
Astonishingly, 85% of all resumes contain false or misleading information, including false degree claims, incorrect or false employment dates, incorrect salary claims, inaccurate job titles, falsified references. These facts alone are reason enough to perform background screenings, but consider that employers are being held liable for employee misconduct, whether or not the misconduct occurs inside the scope or place of employment. Consider further that 85% of corporate theft is internal, resulting in loss to businesses of over billions of dollars each year. With these statistics in mind, and taking into account that new technology has paved the way for cost-effective screening of potential employees, an employer can't afford not to do background screenings.
