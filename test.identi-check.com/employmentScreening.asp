<p>Business owners can't afford to overlook the risk of exposure to a problematic and  dishonest employee. The most cost effective way to mitigate risks is from the  start, when the individual is only a potential candidate. Employers have the  advantage by prescreening to their hiring process. If an organization cannot  demonstrate it has adequately prepared for, and is procedurally consistent in  its efforts to provide a secure work place, it leaves itself vulnerable to  adverse actions and potential lawsuits from violated employees or customers.</p>
